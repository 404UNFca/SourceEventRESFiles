# SourceRESFiles
Contains any event-related .res files from Source Engine games compatible with SourceMod. Very useful for engine-specific plugin development.

## Regarding Garry's Mod
SourceMod no longer supports Garry's Mod (hasn't for years) but it's got a res file so I'm including it any way.

## Easiest way to locate .RES files
1. Navigate to wherever the mod's files are stored, i.e. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf` and search for **\*events.res**
2. (GCFScape required) Check the VPK files (for example `tf2_mic_dir.vpk`) and use GCFScape's built-in search functionality to search for "events.res" with "Match:" set to "substring" and case sensitive unchecked.
