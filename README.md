# SourceRESFiles
Contains any event-related .res files from Source Engine games compatible with SourceMod. Created to help me out with keeping the AlliedModders Wiki's event articles up to date.

## Regarding Garry's Mod
Just in case someone plans on updating articles listed above, don't bother updating the Garry's Mod events article. SourceMod no longer supports Garry's Mod (hasn't for years) and the article really should be deleted.

## Easiest way to locate .RES files
1. Navigate to wherever the mod's files are stored, i.e. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf` and search for **\*events.res**
2. (GCFScape required) Check the VPK files (for example `tf2_mic_dir.vpk`) and use GCFScape's built-in search functionality to search for "events.res" with "Match:" set to "substring" and case sensitive unchecked.
